Bubble Sort: Linked List and Python List Support
This project implements the Bubble Sort algorithm for both Python lists and linked lists. The project utilizes the __iter__ function to enable sorting on a linked list.

Features
Bubble Sort algorithm supports both Python lists and linked lists.

Unit Tests: Includes tests to verify the algorithm works correctly.

GitHub Actions: Automatically runs tests on every push.

Acknowledgments
AI assistance was used during the development, particularly for algorithm implementation and GitHub Actions configuration.
